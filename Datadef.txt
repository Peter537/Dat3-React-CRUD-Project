Game board logic:

    - Max 4 cards on the field for each player
    - a player can hold up to 4 cards on hand (?)
    - a player can choose what slot to place their selected card
      * the selected slot will only be able to either attack the slot infront of it, otherwise it will attack the player

    currentPlayer - between (player) 1 & 2,
    player1Mana - integer (starts 0)
    player2Mana - integer (starts 0)
    maxMana - integer (starts 0)
    player1Health - integer(starts 30)
    player2Health - integer(starts 30)
    player1Hand: []
    player2Hand: [],
    player1Field: [],
    player2Field: [],
